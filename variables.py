#Variables -> Variables are containers for storing data values.

'''
Rules for Python variables:
A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
A variable name cannot start with a number
A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
A variable name cannot be any of the Python keywords.

#The best way to output multiple variables in the print() function is to separate them with commas, which even support different data types:
x = 5
y = "John"
print(x, y)
#Note : int and str can't be added
